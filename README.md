# CelebA CNN Discriminative Project  
### Multi-Celebrity Face Detection and Classification using Deep Learning

This project presents a complete deep learning pipeline for **celebrity face recognition**, combining **single-celebrity image classification** and **multi-celebrity object detection** within a unified framework.  
The system leverages **CNNs, Transfer Learning (VGG16, ResNet50)**, and **YOLOv8** to achieve high accuracy and robust performance under real-world conditions.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

The project focuses on two primary computer vision tasks:

1. **Single-Celebrity Image Classification**  
   Identify a single celebrity from a given image using CNN-based classifiers.

2. **Multi-Celebrity Face Detection**  
   Detect and localize multiple celebrity faces within a single image using object detection.
